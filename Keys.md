## Primary Key (PK)
A primary key is a unique column in a particular table. This is the first column in each of our tables. Here, those columns are all called id, but that doesn't necessarily have to be the name. It is common that the primary key is the first column in our tables in most databases.

## Foreign Key (FK)
A foreign key is a column in one table that is a primary key in a different table. We can see in the Parch & Posey ERD that the foreign keys are:

```
region_id
account_id
sales_rep_id

```
Each of these is linked to the primary key of another table.
